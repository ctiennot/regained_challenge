    This report aims to describe how we tackled the challenge ``Predict the aesthetic score of a portrait by combining photo analysis and facial attributes analysis'' proposed by Regaind as part of... We both emphasis the practical aspect of the work achieved (implementations and computational considerations) and the underlying mathematical models.
    
    \section{Challenge context}
    
    
    \subsection{Pitch}
    
    The idea at Regaind is to automatize the process of sorting photos: what if we could just ask a machine to pick up the best photos to keep them or post them on Instagram? Hence the solution: using machine learning to label pictures and assign them aesthetic scores. In particular the challenge focuses on the task of predicting portrait scores which can be trickier than for more general pictures (e.g. an unwanted closed eye could ruin the whole portrait).
    
    \subsection{Task assessment}
    
    The challenge took the form of supervised learning problem: in total 13~000 portrait photos were provided among which 10~000 had been assigned aesthetic scores between 0 and 24 (averaged over 6 ``markers'' for each photo). Competitors were to submit their ``guessed'' scores for the 3~000 non-labeled portraits.
    
    Each submission was assessed using \textbf{Spearman's rank correlation coefficient} which assesses the strength of the statistical dependence between the ranking/ordering of two variables, in our case the predictions and the true labels. More formally, given the true labels $y_i$'s and the submitted predictions $\hat y_i$'s and the associated ranks $(\text{rg\ } y_i)$'s and $(\text{rg\ } \hat y_i)$'s then the Spearman's rank corre
     coefficient is given by:
     %
     \begin{equation}
	\rho = \frac{\text{cov\ }( \text{rg\ }Y, \text{rg\ } \hat Y)}{\sqrt{\text{Var\ } Y \text{Var\ } \hat Y}}
     \end{equation}
     %
     where $\text{rg\ }Y$ and $\text{rg\ } \hat Y$ are the vectors with the $y_i$'s and the $\hat y_i$'s respectively. By looking at the correlation of the ranks and not the correlation of the two variables themselves Spearman's rho doesn't only capture linear relationships between the to variables. Obviously the higher $\rho$ the better the submission.
     
    
    \subsection{Data}
    
    Images were provided in the \texttt{JPEG} format. They had different dimensions with various width/height ratios. In addition, a few images (?? out of ??) were in black and white. The average width and height were of ?? and ?? pixels.
    
    In addition to the raw images, Regaind provided some extra-features	in \texttt{.csv} files. All along the report we will refer to them as \textbf{meta-features} or \textbf{facial features} since they mainly describe the faces and expressions of people on the portraits.
