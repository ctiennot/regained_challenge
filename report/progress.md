So far I only used the provided features, excluding those that could not be directly converted to be nurmeric. I tried a simple random forest on that (0.43) and boosting (0.506).

Began to look at the pictures and the detected faces. Some pictures are in black and white (no 3rd dimension in numpy) and some other are in colors. Extract faces with the given position, width and height, resize them to be 100*100 and export them as images to the extracted_faces folder.
